# build-a-service-0-to-60

Develop and apply a startup like ecosystem to demonstrates a working understand of end-to-end lifecycle of a service from development to production infrastructure. Leverage as much continous deployment and infrastructural automation as possible along the way.

## Objectives

Ensure the ecosystem you develop is 

    - [ ] Observable
    - [ ] Resilient 
    - [ ] Scalable
    - [ ] Automated
    
### Service(s)

Develop a set of service(s) that handle requests. The function of the service is arbitrary but it should leverage common principles of a scalable service with regards to concurrency, asynchronous workflows, observability, etc.

### Infrastructure 

Develop an infrastructure that can be composed and destroyed consistently and easily. The composed architecture should also be observable, resilient and automated. One solution is leverage the HashiStack where applicable. Their stack has many solutions that can help develop an automated infrastucture such as Vagrant, Packer, Terraform, Vault, Consul, and Nomad. 

## Document Your Learnings

While doing this exercise be sure to take concise notes of you learnings along the way. One way to do this is to blog while you are doing it. This will ensure that you are sharing the knowledge you are compiling, which conincedently is the best way to demonstrate that you comprehend what you are learning.
